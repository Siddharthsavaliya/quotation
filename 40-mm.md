# 40MM STD MACHINE JSON Configuration

## Overview

This JSON file (`40-mm.json`) defines the configuration, options, and pricing for a "40MM STD MACHINE" (a high-performance extruder). It is structured to be used by a backend or frontend application to dynamically generate forms, calculate prices, and display machine specifications.

## Structure

- **name**: The name of the machine.
- **description**: A short description of the machine.
- **fields**: An array of field objects, each representing a configurable property, option, or specification of the machine.

### Each Field Object

Each field in the `fields` array represents a single input or output in the machine configuration. The main properties are:

- **fieldId**: Unique identifier for the field.
- **title**: The label or name shown to the user.
- **type**: The type of input (`text`, `number`, `dropdown`).
- **section**: Used to group fields (e.g., 1 for technical, 2 for commercial).
- **valueType**: The data type (`string`, `float`).
- **value**: The default or current value. Can be a simple value or a mapping for dynamic fields.
- **options**: For dropdowns, the available choices, each with a label, value, and price adjustment (`amount`).
- **isRequired**: Whether the field must be filled.
- **isEditable**: Whether the user can change the value.
- **isDynamic**: If true, the field's value or options depend on another field.
- **refreshDynamicField**: The `fieldId` of the field this one depends on.

## How Dynamic Fields Work

Some fields change their value or options based on the selection in another field. For example:

- The "Barrel Heating zones" field (`fieldId: 3`) changes based on the selected "Screw L/D Ratio type 1" (`fieldId: 2`).
- The "Screw Output capacity" (`fieldId: 11`) options depend on the "Screw design type" (`fieldId: 9`).

This is achieved by:
- Setting `isDynamic: true`
- Using `refreshDynamicField` to point to the controlling field
- Storing values/options as objects keyed by the controlling field's value

## Example: Dropdown with Dynamic Options

```json
{
  "fieldId": "11",
  "title": "Screw Output capacity",
  "type": "dropdown",
  "valueType": "string",
  "section": 1,
  "options": [
    {
      "Standard": [
        { "label": "35kg/hr for BIO", "value": "35kg/hr for BIO", "amount": 0 }
      ]
    },
    {
      "Barrier": [
        { "label": "40kg/hr for BIO", "value": "40kg/hr for BIO", "amount": 0 }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "refreshDynamicField": "9",
  "isDynamic": true,
  "isRequired": true
}
```
- If "Screw design type" is "Standard", only the "Standard" options are shown.
- If "Barrier", only the "Barrier" options are shown.

## How to Create a New Machine JSON

1. **Copy the structure**: Use this file as a template.
2. **Change the name and description**.
3. **Edit the fields**:
   - Add, remove, or modify fields as needed.
   - For each field, set the appropriate properties.
   - For dropdowns, define the `options` array.
   - For dynamic fields, set `isDynamic: true` and `refreshDynamicField`.
4. **Set default values** in the `value` property.
5. **Adjust pricing** using the `amount` property in dropdown options.

## What Each Section Represents

- **section: 1**: Technical specifications and machine configuration.
- **section: 2**: Commercial details (price, tax, warranty, etc.).

## Example Field

```json
{
  "fieldId": "2",
  "title": "Screw L/D Ratio type 1",
  "type": "dropdown",
  "valueType": "string",
  "section": 1,
  "value": { "first": "26:1" },
  "options": [
    { "first": [
      { "label": "26:1", "value": "26:1", "amount": 0 },
      { "label": "32:1", "value": "32:1", "amount": 75000 }
    ] }
  ],
  "isRequired": true
}
```
- This field lets the user select the screw L/D ratio.
- The price increases by 75,000 if "32:1" is selected.

## Pricing

- The base price is set in the "PRICE (INR)" field.
- Selecting certain options (in dropdowns) can increase or decrease the price via the `amount` property.

## Summary

- This JSON is a machine configuration template.
- It supports dynamic fields, pricing, and validation.
- You can create new machine files by following this structure and adjusting fields as needed.
